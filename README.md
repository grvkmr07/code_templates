* Here goes my repository for all essentials in ***Problem solving.***
* I love **C++** 
* Problem Solving is just everything. Great at it makes you an all-rounder. A quick-learner, decision maker, problem solver, makes you creative and alot more. ***I can't have a better hobby than this***
* Backend is always the thing that matters the most. I definitely believe that Frontend brings people but it's the backend that retains the them and you grow.
